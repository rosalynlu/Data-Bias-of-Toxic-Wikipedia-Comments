115,  balance  this page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word and a huge amount about the slangprofane uses perhaps the former should be extended is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name this is an encyclopaedia not a dictionary     i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipediaimmediatly this word is used very often and is also a very mean word i belive that is majorly true very much so okay so the good meaning is a female dog  bitch it also stands for the name brittany fellows—preceding unsigned comment added by   •     etymology  the word bitch is from the old norse bikkjuna meaning female of the dog of unknown origin grimm derives the old norse words from lapp pittja but oed notes that the converse is equally possible  the adj bitchy was first seen in 1925   the verb meaning to complain in 1930  slang bitchen good is attested to the 1950s   reclaiming the word bitch   the word bitch is actually only offencive in american and canadian english in most other english variants bitch maintains its correct definition  female canine people have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult  but so is pig dog cow and others these are not considered profane so why is bitch as far as i am concerned there is nothing to reclaim as bitch simply means a female canine  it may be used as a pejorative or descriptor  that does not make it a profanity      it should definately say something about kyle vanderweilen and all his bitchin is there any particular evidence of women reclaiming the word bitch in the 90s can anyone point to articles on this etc the song is definitely interesting and belongs here but doesnt actually reclaim the word bitch any more than it reclaims the word sinner  also i dont really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  i was going to try and clear it up but i realized i dont know what it means can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches fertility and patriarchy more clearly   we dont need articles at all as i there are definitely enough examples even outside of the 90s missy elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word for instance shes a bitch    references are fine  just the name missy elliot got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned reclaiming the word in fact if some one knows more about her it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to womenslurs more generally within hiphop    how relevant is this reclamation it seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits i dont see how using a word connoting querolous spiteful and malicious can be empowering but i dont know lifes a bitch    it stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesnt adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch to use a literary example in the novel the handmaids tale the narrator related the feeling that whenever she outsmarted a man she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind even her own husband     that literary reaction you recited is jealousy men have names for other men who outsmart them too but not having a word like bitch for them they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets though you havent been specific i think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination which both sexes often strive to impose on the other but men have traditionally had more power because it is such a popular epithet in slang the connotations of bitch are diffuse though still commonly pernicious i think bitch in itself is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard but rather a contemptuous word often used for it  however i still dont see the point of reclamati,no,0.15600902,16
